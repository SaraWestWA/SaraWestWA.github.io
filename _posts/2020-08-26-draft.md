## How it all started


Remember color-by-number from childhood? Some kids hated those. Me, I had my mother make regular pictures into color-by-number, now I knew exactly what to do! Fast forward a few years. “Pick a topic for your paper…”. That’s the hardest part, then to make it long enough... I would rather prove a theorem, thank you.

Fast forward many more years; I have forgotten almost everything about proving theorems. Hence, I am studying Data Science at Lambda School. It’s time to begin my Unit 2 Build Project. “Pick a data set…” Ugh, the worst part. I found this data set on Kaggle, it seemed tidy and was brand new. I was so busy learning the mechanics from my lessons, I didn’t notice a problem. Little did I know, a highly imbalanced data isn’t a great choice for a beginner. Trying to find a way to distinguish a tiny amount of data from all of the rest proved to be tricky. I learned about a new technique. Soon everything was going swimmingly. Then, the weekend before the project was due I happened upon a bit of information that set off that little niggling feeling… Sure enough, I had misunderstood how to apply the new technique. What I thought was working well was hardly working at all… I am back to looking for needles in a pin stack, everything looks alike.

## The Project
### The Data

TVS is a lending institution which provides both secured and unsecured loans. A secured loan has something which can be repossessed if a customer defaults, for example, a two-wheeled vehicle. A personal loan is an example of an unsecured loan, if the customer fails to pay, the money is lost.

The data set is comprised of information on TVS customers who have already taken out a loan for a two-wheeled vehicle and would like to take out a personal loan as well. Around 2% of TVS borrowers default on their vehicle loans. If TVS can predict who will default on one loan, they will know not to approve another.

There is no data available about the people whose loan applications were denied. Hence, defaulters cannot be compared to the denied clients to find similarities. All of the clients have already passed through the TVS loan approval process.

Initially there were about 120,000 clients listed in my data set, with 32 possible pieces of non-identifying information about each one. This client information is referred to as features or columns. Several features with information gathered after the first payment date were removed. In addition, the TVS data was missing a lot of information, which required dropping both clients and columns with too many holes. Now there were about 85,000 clients and 17 columns of information.

Notice all of the zeros in the chart. None of the models identified a single defaulter! The baseline for all of my models was 0.

### Balancing the Data
I tried two techniques for balancing the data.

Downsampling was done by cutting down list of the non-defaulters to approximately the same number as defaulters. The resulting models found 79-89% of the defaulters! Unfortunately, they also labeled 74-89% of the other clients defaulters. Better, but still far from useful.

SMOTE, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, SMOTE works the opposite of downsampling. SMOTE was used to create a fictional population of defaulters to balance out the non-defaulters. It sounds a little fanciful, but is proven to be legitimate in the world of data science. This technique resulted in models slightly better than the models made with downsampled data.

The best model I created was a Logistic Regression model using SMOTE data and an ROC curve. The ROC curve pinpoints the best baseline for a given model. The baseline for this model was

I employed two methods for balancing the data. Downsampling, was done by cutting down list of the non-defaulters to approximately the same number as defaulters; referred to as “down” in my illustrations. The other method is Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, SMOTE for short. SMOTE creates a fictional population of defaulters so that there are an even number of defaulters and non-defaulters. It sounds a little fanciful, but is proven to be legitimate.

 I experimented with downsampling the data until there were 10-20% defaulters and then using SMOTE to balance the numbers. This technique did not improve results and was discarded.

The model result: Unless TVS wants to sell a large percentage of their personal loans to another lender, my models are not particularly useful.

The end: I learned a lot about the mechanics of making models.

**Years are “marketing years” as defined by the USDA. Data is from beekeeping operations with five or more colonies. Thirty-three states have participated in the USDA honey production survey every year since 1987. Thus, “USA” numbers are a reflection of only these participating states. Actual national honey production may differ.
