### "The murder hornets are coming!"

"Murder hornets" have been discovered near the northern boarder of Washington state. They earned this moniker not for the danger they pose to humans, but because they decimate other bee colonies in a somewhat grisley fashion. They pop off the heads of their victims, bring the heads back as a feast for their young, and later return to the now unihabited hive collect the honey. These are certainly not the neighbors our honeybees need! What is going to happen to our honeybees if these invaders aren't controlled? Click here to find some interesting information on that topic:

### "How our honeybees faring now?"
Examining honey production can be a good way to look for answers to that question. Since 1987 the USDA has been tracking honey production throughout the United States.There is a great diversity of climate and acerage in our states. Pounds produced per colony allows comparison of disparate state honey production.

### A national snapshot

Hawaii produces the most honey per colony and Maine the lowest, Washington also comes in below the national average. This measurement is useful for comparing to our neighbors and certainly of high interest to beekeepers. However, it does not give a complete picture of honey production in Washington.

There are several factors which have had a lasting impact on honey production in the United States. In 1987 varroa mites first appeared in the United States. If unchecked a varroa mite infestation will kill a colony in 2-4 years. According to the USDA varroa mites continue to be the biggest stessor for honey bee colonies.

In 2006 a phenomenon of hives abandoned by worker bees was observed, this is now called Colony Collapse Disorder.
